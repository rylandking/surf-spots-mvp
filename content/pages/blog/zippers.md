bestTide: medium
spotNoteOld: 'Fast, fun right and left hand reef breaks right across the channel from each other. The right has a fairly easy drop, but steepens up quickly for a barrel or a good turn or two and then closes out. The left is longer and provides a better wall to pull into or do top-to-bottom turns on.   The bay is very open to the Southerly swells so it picks up a lot of swell here. It’ll get maxed out once it’s bigger than 5-6ft at 13-16sec. It’s best with a Northeast wind, which isn’t too common for the region. The mornings and evenings are usually fairly calm on the wind-front. If you want to get it at it’s best expect to paddle out in the early morning or late evening. The low tide causes the reef to go nearly dry in front of the wave, so you want to be out during the medium and high tides. There are pretty significant tidal swings here, like 8ft+ from high to low, so be very aware of which direction the tide is going. We highly recommend brining and wearing reef boodies as the reef is sharp and shallow.  There can be a bit of a crowd when it’s on, but it’s never insanely crowded because the location is extremely remote. There’s waves here in the offseason too. You just risk hitting a week long or longer flat spell if you decide to head out then.  You have to walk about 200 meters North across a calm river to check the surf. It’s probably best to bring your boards and some water when you go for a surf check because if it’s good you won’t want to walk back and forth again. Paddle out through the deepwater channel. It’ll take 5-10 minutes to paddle out to the line up. After your surf head back to your lodge or one of the nearby lodges to hang out and get some grub. Bring books, playing cards or board games as there isn’t internet here. Where you stay will likely be hard to check the wave.     You will also be far away from any cities, internet or healthcare at Yo Yos. If you get extremely hurt, you will have to get helicoptered hours away to an international hospital in Nusa Dua or Bali. In 2015, Jeremy Flores, a pro surfer, went head first into the reef on the inside section of the left at the nearby Lakey Peak while surfing at low tide. He had a major concussion and memory loss for over two hours. Him and his mates called their insurance company for a helicopter and were told it’d be there immediately, but it didn’t show up for over 12+ hours. This is how far from civilization you are. Get travelers insurance, come with a detailed first aid kit and surf safely.  Get here by flying into Lombok International Airport on a regional airline from Denpasar Bali. At the Lombok Airport ask a taxi to take you to Labuhan Harbor, which will take about two hours and cost you about $30. Be aware that most taxis have a maximum capacity of four people. At the Labuhan Harbor book one of the two hour and a half long ferry trips that run each day to Benete Harbor on Sumbawa. Our best knowledge is that these trips run from Labuhan, Lombok to Benete, Sumbawa at 10:00 and 16:15 and from Benete, Sumbawa to Labuhan, Lombok at 10:00 and 16:15. The ferry should cost you about $15. Once in Benete Harbor, take a taxi the 30 minute drive to Yo Yos. This should cost you about $25 and most taxis here have a four person maximum too. Once you’re there score some waves and enjoy your stay.'
