spotNoteOld: 'Fun, pitching beach break with waves for almost every skill level. Beginner waves are at the North of the beach, expert waves are to the South. The further South you go the more top-to-bottom waves you''ll start to see. You can definitely find a good barrel here and there with a solid summer South swell. Park for free along the highway or there is a paid lot to use right across from the beach. Grab your post surf lunch grub at the classic Mexican spot Coral Beach Cantina.'
