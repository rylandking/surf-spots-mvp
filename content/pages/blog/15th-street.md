  Super fun intermediate beach break waves with a killer beach and grassy area
  for families and friends. One of those spots that you can almost always have
  fun at at any time of the year. Go with a bit of caution in the winter time,
  as if there is a big winter Northwest swell the waves can become pretty
  gnarly. Park in the lot just after 18th Street and walk South for a minute or
  two to get to the waves. Do a fancy meal at Jake’s Del Mar or head out to
  Board and Brew for a cheaper, more relaxed option after your surf day.
